## Scripts
1. `sanitize.py` Fetches data from database or reads from a file, cleans the data, extract the required fields and pass it on to `models.py`
2 .`models.py` Uses the clean data from `sanitize.py` and builds the forecasting model
3. `app.py` Uses data from generated by the model's predictions in `models.py`, formats the data according to db schema, then inserts into db
4. `request.py` Implements a flask web api as can serve predictions over a post request instead of writing into our db

## How to use

- [x] pip install -r requirements.txt
